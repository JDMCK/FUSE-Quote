# FUSE_Quote
An application to make quoting for FUSE easier and more efficient

Purpose:
To exist as an app on both Android and iOS to make quoting/estimating easier and more efficient.

Development Goals:

Tier 1:
    Options to select any service that FUSE provides, such as window cleaning or drive ways, and allows the user to quickly generate a price for the client on site. The layout will be clean and have the FUSE logo. The prices of each service will also be determined by a database that only an admin can edit.

Tier 2:
    Tier 1 plus a prompt to sign in to prevent non-employee entry. This also allows for special permissions to be granted to administrative users.

Tier 3:
    Tier 2 plus a storage system for quotes. You may save, and edit your quotes and even add pictures to go along with.
